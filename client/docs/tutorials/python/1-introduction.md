# Python Quickstart Tutorial: Building an A2A Agent

Welcome to the Agent2Agent (A2A) Python Quickstart Tutorial!

In this tutorial, you will build a simple "echo" A2A server using Python. This initial barebones implementation will introduce you to the fundamental concepts and components of an A2A server. You will then progressively enhance this server, culminating in an agent powered by a local Ollama model.

This hands-on guide will help you understand:

- The basic concepts behind the A2A protocol.
- How to set up a Python project for A2A development.
- How to define Agent Skills and create an Agent Card.
- How to implement a basic A2A server that handles tasks.
- How to interact with your A2A server using a client.
- How to incorporate streaming capabilities and handle multi-turn interactions.
- How to integrate a Large Language Model (LLM) using Ollama to create a more intelligent agent.

By the end of this tutorial, you will have a functional A2A agent and a solid foundation for building more complex A2A-compliant applications.
